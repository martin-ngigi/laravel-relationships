One-To-One Eloquent relationship
----------------------------------
-Relationship is talking about one User that has one Profile.
    And if you're talking about Something that has something(s) else, you usually add this column to the second model.
    You could say that the first model 'possesses' the second model'.
    i.e. we place an "user_id" on the Profile model and NOT  "profile_id" on the User model.
